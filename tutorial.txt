== How to Use Contact Flow ==

1. Create a New Flow:
   - On the main screen, fill in the "Flow Name" and set a "Duration" for your contact collection session.
   - You can also configure optional settings to enhance your session:
     - **Contact Name Prefix**: Adds a specific prefix (e.g., "Event24_") to the beginning of every contact's name.
     - **WhatsApp Group Link**: Displays a prominent, glowing link on the contact form for users to join your WhatsApp group.
     - **Session Password**: Secures your session. Users will need to enter this password before they can add their contact information.
   - Click the "Launch Flow" button.

2. Share Your Session:
   - After creation, you'll be directed to the session dashboard.
   - Click the "Copy Link" button to copy the unique URL for your session to your clipboard.
   - Share this link with anyone from whom you want to collect contact information.

3. Collect Contacts:
   - When someone opens your shared link, they will see a form to enter their details (Name, Phone Number, etc.).
   - If you set a password, they will be prompted to enter it before they can access the form.
   - The system automatically prevents duplicate entries based on the phone number to ensure your list is clean.

4. Manage and Download Contacts:
   - From your session dashboard, you can monitor the number of contacts collected in real-time.
   - Once your session expires, or at any point during the session, you can download the collected contacts.
   - You have two convenient download options:
     - **Download VCF**: A standard vCard file format that can be easily imported into the contacts app on any mobile device (iOS or Android).
     - **Download CSV**: A comma-separated values file, perfect for opening in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Apple Numbers.

Thank you for using Contact Flow! We hope you enjoy the seamless experience.
