Welcome to Contact Flow!

== Quick Start Guide ==

1. Environment Setup:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory.
   - Add the following Supabase credentials and Global Contacts JSON to your `.env` file:
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
     VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
     VITE_GLOBAL_CONTACTS_JSON='[
       { "name": "Example Contact 1", "phone": "+12345678900", "email": "example1@example.com", "company": "Example Corp 1" },
       { "name": "Example Contact 2", "phone": "+09876543211", "email": "example2@example.com", "company": "Example Corp 2" }
     ]'
   - Replace `"YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"`, `"YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"`, and `"YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"` with your actual Supabase project details.
   - The `VITE_GLOBAL_CONTACTS_JSON` is optional. If you want certain contacts to be automatically added to every new session, define them here in JSON format. Otherwise, you can leave it as an empty array `[]` or omit the variable.

2. Installation:
   - Open your terminal in the project's root directory.
   - Run `npm install` to install all the required packages and dependencies. This includes the Supabase client.

3. Running the Application:
   - After the installation is complete, run `npm run dev`.
   - The application will start on port 1570. You can access it at http://localhost:1570 in your web browser.

== How to Use Contact Flow ==

1. Create a New Flow:
   - On the main screen, fill in the "Flow Name" and set a "Duration" for your contact collection session.
   - Optional settings:
     - **Contact Name Prefix**: Adds a prefix to every contact's name.
     - **WhatsApp Group Link**: Displays a link on the contact form.
     - **Session Password**: Secures your session.
   - Click "Launch Flow". Sessions and initial global contacts (if configured) are automatically saved to your Supabase database.

2. Share Your Session:
   - From the dashboard, click "Copy Link" to get the unique session URL.
   - Share this link to collect contacts.

3. Collect Contacts:
   - Users opening the link will see a form.
   - If a password was set, they'll need to enter it.
   - Contacts are saved directly to your Supabase database. Duplicate phone numbers within the same session are prevented.

4. Manage and Download Contacts:
   - The session dashboard shows real-time contact counts from Supabase.
   - Download contacts as VCF or CSV files.
   - Expired sessions and their associated contacts will be automatically deleted from the database three days after the session's expiration time.

== Supabase Integration Notes ==

- All session data and contact information are stored in your Supabase project.
- Make sure your Supabase database has the `sessions` and `contacts` tables created. The necessary SQL for this is usually handled by the application or can be found in the project's database migration scripts if provided.
- The application also sets up a Supabase Edge Function and a cron job to handle the automatic deletion of old data (sessions and contacts older than 3 days past expiry). Ensure your Supabase project has cron jobs enabled and Edge Functions deployed if this functionality is critical.

Thank you for using Contact Flow! We hope you enjoy the seamless, database-powered experience.
